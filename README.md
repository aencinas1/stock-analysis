# An Analysis of Stocks and Refactoring Code to Be More Efficient 

In this analysis, We took a look at a sample of stocks and their returns from 2017 and 2018.

I was successful in making the code more efficient, more stable, and less redundant, and more friendly to a larger data sample.

## The Results
